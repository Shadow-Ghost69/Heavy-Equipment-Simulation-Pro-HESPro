Description:

This project aims to reduce unplanned downtime, increase on-running time, and maximize heavy equipment profit on XYZ company construction projects through the Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) approach. By modeling the interaction between mechanical crews and heavy equipment units, this study tests the optimization scenario of the number of crews and heavy equipment replacement rules. 

It can prove that the effectiveness of ABM in optimizing heavy equipment management, while emphasizing the importance of (Preventive Maintenance) PM-based equipment replacement policies and efficient resource allocation. Moreover, this project provides practical contributions to reducing operational costs and improving the sustainability of large-scale construction projects.
